# Plotting Grid Data


If you don't have Monte Carlo chains, and have grid evaluations instead, that's fine too!

Just flatten your grid, set the weights to the grid evaluation, and set the grid flag. Here is
a nice diamond that you get from modifying a simple multivariate normal distribution.

Note that by default, grid data is not smoothed, though you can explicitly set the smooth
parameter when you make the Chain object if you want.

Note that you *cannot* use dictionary input with the grid method and not specify the full
flattened array. This is because we cannot construct the meshgrid from a dictionary, as
the order of the parameters is not preserved in the dictionary.
