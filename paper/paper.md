# Summary

ChainConsumer is a python package written to consume the output chains
of Monte-Carlo processes and fitting algorithms, such as the results
of MCMC.

ChainConsumer's main function is to produce plots of the likelihood
surface inferred from the supplied chain. In addition to showing
the two-dimensional marginalised likelihood surfaces, marginalised
parameter distributions are given, and maximum-likelihood statistics
are used to present parameter constraints.

In addition to this, parameter constraints can be output
in the form of a LaTeX table. Finally, ChainConsumer also provides
the functionality to plot the chains as a series of walks in
parameter values, which provides an easy visual check on chain
mixing and chain convergence.

Plotting is performed via the matplotlib library [@matplotlib], and
makes use of various numpy [@numpy] and scipy [@scipy] functions. The
optional KDE feature makes use of [@statsmodels].

Code archives can be found on Zenodo at [@zenodo] and any
bugs or feature requests can be opened as issues on the Github
development page [@github].
